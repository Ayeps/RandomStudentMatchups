RandomStudentMatchups
---------------------
A simple Swing GUI or console based app for creating random groups of students from a file list, where the groups are balanced as much as possible. This is a standard Netbeans project setup for JDK 7 but that can easily be changed to JDK 6 because no special JDK 7 features are used. See JavaDocs for more info.
